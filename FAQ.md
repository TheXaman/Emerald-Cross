## Mechanics:

### Will later-generation battle mechanics be implemented? What about the physical/special split?
No. This hack aims to preserve the original battle mechanics and maintain link compatibility with the vanilla games. Changing the battle mechanics runs contrary to those goals.

### Will new moves be implemented? New held items?
No. This hack aims to preserve the original battle mechanics and maintain link compatibility with the vanilla games. Adding new moves or held items runs contrary to those goals.

### Will the Generation VI+ Experience Share be implemented?
No.

### Will you improve breeding mechanics?
Probably a bit in the future. This will not affect shiny rates.

### What are the shiny chances? Will they be improved?
The shiny chance is 1/8192, as it was in Generation III. The odds of encountering a shiny Pokémon will not be increased.

### Will you add something to change my Pokémon's IVs/Hidden Power/Nature/etc.?
I'm still considering this because the Battle Frontier is a big part of Pokémon Emerald. However, this would only be accesed as a post-game stuff with BPs.

## Pokémon Availability:

### Will you add later-generation Pokémon?
No. This hack aims to maintain link compatibility with the vanilla games and keep all obtainable Pokémon legal in Generation III.

### How many Pokémon are available? Will *all* Pokémon be catchable?
At the moment the same as vanilla Emerald. This hack does not add any new Pokémon that were not available in Generation III. To complete the National Dex, trade with the vanilla games. This is not a 386 hack, and not all Pokémon will be obtainable without trading.

### Can you change wild Pokémon availability/levels? Can you put *x* Pokémon in *y* map? Will you add more Pokémon in the future?
One of the goals of this hack is to make every Pokémon available to the player legal in Generation III. This means that modifying existing Pokémon encounters or adding new Pokémon to existing encounter tables would make illegal Pokémon obtainable.

If you want more Pokémon, trade with vanilla.


### Can I obtain the other Hoenn starters? Can I obtain the unchosen fossil?
No, and there are no plans for those at the momment.

## Troubleshooting Savefiles, Emulators, and Flashcarts:

### Is my vanilla Emerald save compatible with Emerald Cross?
No. The save needed to be edited to add certain features, and therefore vanilla saves are incompatible with Emerald Cross. Similarly, Emerald Cross saves cannot be used in vanilla.

### My emulator/flashcart doesn't work with Emerald Cross! The game won't save!
The recommended emulator for desktop is [mGBA](https://mgba.io/downloads.html).

If your emulator or flashcart isn't working properly with Emerald Cross, follow instructions for that particular emulator or flashcart for playing vanilla Emerald and apply them to getting Emerald Cross to work. If a patch is required to get vanilla Emerald to save properly, then Emerald is incompatible with that emulator or flashcart.

## Modifying Emerald Cross:

### Can I use Emerald Cross as a ROM Base?
My official stance is that all mods of Emerald Cross are unauthorized and unsupported. If you choose to use Emerald Cross as a ROM Base, I will not offer any support nor answer questions regarding developing a mod of this hack.

### How did you implement *x* feature? Can I use *y* feature for my hack?
If you want to grab something from Emerald Cross, go back through my commits and find where I implemented it. I don't offer support or answer questions for lifting things from Emerald Cross, but since the project is open source anyone can take from it.

## Miscellaneous:

### Will text be decapitalized?
No.

### How do I link to other games? When is the earliest I can link?
At the momment, the same as vanilla Emerald. This might change in the future.

### I prefer the Pokémon Emerald summary screen
You are out of luck then! Adding that screen allowed me to add support to cool stuff like the move category indicator, favlor texts, more info in the trainer memo and so on.
